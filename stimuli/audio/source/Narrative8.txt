Gloria and her brother, Jim had been planning a month long vacation together to a small town in Europe. The day before their trip, Gloria informed Jim that she couldn’t go on the trip because her husband, Steve, no longer wanted her to go (Necessity of Sacrificing Loved Ones).
Jim understood but decided to go on the trip without her. When Jim did not return after a month, Gloria found out that Jim had been abducted (Abduction).
Gloria was devastated and looked to Steve for support. Steve was not supportive in the way that she needed, so she turned to a coworker named Derek and he was there for her in every way possible. The two of them started spending a lot of time together and quickly developed a romantic relationship. Gloria and Derek decided that they wanted to be together and that Steve was in the way (Adultery).
 
One day, Gloria and Derek were having dinner in the city together. Steve found them and confronted them about the affair. Steve pled for Gloria to stay with him, but she refused and demanded a divorce (Obtaining).
Steve turned to Derek and begged him not to take his wife from him; but Derek refused because he was in love with Gloria (Supplication).
Gloria exclaimed that it was her decision and that she was going to choose Derek over Steve (Rivalry of Kin). 

The next day, Gloria and Derek fled to Gloria’s family’s beach house to be alone. When they got to the beach house, they found Gloria’s brother, Jim tied up to a chair (Recovery of Lost One). 
Apparently, he had never left for Europe but was being held captive. Gloria rushed to him, but as she was about to untie him, Jim’s abductor seized Gloria and threw her to the ground (Rivalry of Superior Versus Inferior).
In defense of Gloria and Jim, Derek grabbed a lamp and hit the abductor so hard that he died (Slaying of Kin Unrecognized). Gloria released her brother and the two were finally reunited.
