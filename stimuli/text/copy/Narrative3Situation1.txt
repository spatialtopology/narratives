It was just another Sunday afternoon for Lucy, she was on her way to the farmer’s market to pick up some produce. When she arrived at the old train depot that housed the market, she noticed two men fighting on the steps. Before she could call for help, one of the men crumpled to his knees. The other man dropped an object that appeared to be a knife and ran off. When Lucy approached the crime scene she realized that the man who had been murdered was the Mayor and that he had a gunshot wound.
