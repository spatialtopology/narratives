Suddenly, Luke heard a woman call out his name and when he turned around he saw Carly, his receptionist, across the road with a gun in her hand. Carly ran to him and explained how she had followed him here to confess her love. She exclaimed if Luke didn’t love her back that she would kill him and his family. Carly explained that the only way they could be together is to kill Marta.
