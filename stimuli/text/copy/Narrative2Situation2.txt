This feeling of hate between Amy and Dan was mutual, Dan didn’t like how much time his wife spent with her and thought Amy was creating distance between their marriage. That’s why Dan decided to try and tarnish Linda’s reputation with his wife, in hopes it would get rid of her. He came home one afternoon and exclaimed that Linda had tried to kiss him. Amy was taken aback and immediately called Linda to confront her about these accusations. When Linda arrived she denied having made a move on Dan, but discovered Dan had enlisted the help of his friend Will who said he witnessed it all happen.
