Luke explained he needed closure and told her how much he hated her for killing his wife. Carly was heartbroken over this because she had held on to this delusion that Luke still loved her after all these years. Once back in her cell she began to plot how to get back at Luke, she blamed him for her lifelong sentence and vowed to break out. She wanted to make him feel just as miserable as she did, and she knew the only way to do that was to take what he loved most, his son. She flirted with a guard who she knew was sweet on her and convinced him to help her escape.
