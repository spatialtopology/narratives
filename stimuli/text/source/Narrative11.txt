Darrell was recently fired from his job; he was convinced that his coworker Richard was the one behind him losing his job. The two decided to meet at a coffee shop in the city to talk over everything that happened. Darrell decided that he was going to pretend to be nice but then yell at Richard for the role he played in Darrell losing his job (Revolt).
However, Richard never showed up for the meeting, because he was never actually involved in Darrell getting fired (Pursuit).
Feeling guilty, and disapproving of the way their company did business, Richard decided to quit his job. Little did he know, the company decided to give Darrell Richard’s position after he quit (Self-Sacrifice for an Ideal).
 
After finding out that Darrell got his job, Richard was very angry and asked his brother, Frank, to meet him in the forest outside town to plot his revenge against Darrell (Enmity of Kin).
Darrell was not privy to the fact that Frank was sleeping with his wife, Laurie. While talking in the forest, Frank learned about the job position and was jealous of Darrell for the job he was pursuing and the wife he had (Mistaken Jealousy).
After Darrell had left the forest, Frank met Laurie in the woods and together, they devised a plan to kill Darrell so Frank could have his job and Laurie and him could be together (Murderous Adultery). 

Frank and Laurie escaped to a beach house to plot the kill. Later that day Darrell found them at the house and learned of their affair. Frank and Darrell started fighting; Frank managed to overcome Darrell (Rivalry of Superior Versus Inferior).
As Frank had Darrell pinned down, Darrell exclaimed that he just wanted Laurie to be happy so if she wanted to be with Frank, he would back off. Frank released Darrell and Darrell left the house, leaving Frank and Laurie to be together. (All Sacrificed for Passion, Self-Sacrifice for Kin)
