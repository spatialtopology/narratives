George and Mark were coworkers at the prison, but the two despised each other. George had been married to Juli for two years but he wasn’t unaware that she had been having an affair with Mark. One day Mark and Juli met in the park and decided that Juli was going to leave George, and the two of them were going to run away (Adultery).
Mark left Juli, but before she could run away, George found her in the park (Recovery of a Loved One).
He confronted her because he thought that she was sleeping with his brother. When Juli heard that George thought she was sleeping with his brother, she fled from him (Pursuit).

At work, at the prison the next day, George was very angry because he wanted his wife back (Ambition).
Juli came into the prison to confront George and tell him that she wanted a divorce. Juli told George that Mark was the man she had been having an affair with; he grew even angrier because he despised Mark (An Enemy Loved).
Juli left the room and Mark walked in behind her. In a fit of anger George lunged at Mark with a chair and knocked him out killing him (Slaying of Kin Unrecognized). 

Juli heard the noise and ran in to see what George had done (Discovery of Dishonor of Loved One).
Before anyone could see, George took Mark’s body to the swamp just beyond the prison. Because they had been married, Juli helped George with Mark’s body (All Sacrificed for Passion).
As they were about to push Mark’s body into the swamp, the prison police caught them. George was immediately handcuffed and taken away. As they were taking George, Juli screamed at George for what he had done Mark and exclaimed that she played no part in Mark’s death (Vengeance Taken for Kin Upon Kin).
