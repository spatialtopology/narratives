Max and Danielle were having a lovely picnic in the forest to celebrate their wedding anniversary. With all the romance in the air, Max was feeling guilty. He confessed to Danielle that he had been having an affair with another woman (Discovery of Dishonour of Loved One).
Danielle started yelling at him and pushed him; the force was so great that he fell over and knocked his head on rock and lost consciousness (Slaying of Kin Unrecognized).
Little did she know, there were rangers in the forest doing a search and witnessed the event. The rangers immediately arrested Danielle (Disaster).

She screamed that it was an accident, but her cries did not help. For days, Daniell’s parents did not know where she was. Finally, they were informed that she was being held in an interrogation room in prison (Recovery of Lost One).
The police gave her parents an opportunity to visit with Danielle. While talking to her in the prison, Danielle and her parents decided that they must find a way to get her out (Revolt).
While they believed no one was watching, the parents attempted to sneak their daughter out of the interrogation room. Just as they were leaving the prison, and thought they had freed their daughter, they were chased down by the police; Danielle was handcuffed and taken back into custody (Rivalry of Superior Versus Inferior). 

Returning to their home on the beach, Danielle’s parents prayed to God to help their daughter. They felt conflicted because their daughter had wronged another human but they wanted their daughter out of prison (Conflicting with God).
The parents called the prison and pleaded to release their daughter because she didn’t mean to hurt Max. The police said that she had committed a murder and there was nothing more they could do for them (Obtaining).
The parents could not handle the pain of their daughter being in prison and committed suicide together (Madness).
