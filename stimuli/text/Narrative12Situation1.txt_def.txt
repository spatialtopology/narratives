Larry had recently lost his family, job and home, and was now living on his own in the park. He had most of his belongings, including some clothes, a blanket, and his mother’s special necklace. His family had been very important to him and he felt as though he did not have much going for him. One of his first days in the park he came across a family that did not have much food and looked very cold. He decided to give them some of his food and his blanket.
