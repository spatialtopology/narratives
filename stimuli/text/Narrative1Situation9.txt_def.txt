Margaret went to a local bar to drown out her pain. After a few drinks at a quiet bar, she went to the back of the bar to use the facilities. On her way back, she heard someone approaching her from behind with a shuffled gait. She turned around and realized it was the man that was keeping her captive! Before she could make a sound, he covered her mouth with a rag and pulled her out the back of the bar – never to be seen again.
